## TODO

```
* hasMany removes deleted models (internal.addObserver and so on)
* model.load calls from prop access
* belongsTo({ selector: {} }) loaded
* hasMany loaded
* embedded models (persisted as a { key: { model } })
* while deserializing model, if relationship has deleted docId, model should be set dirty and relationship should not include the model
```
