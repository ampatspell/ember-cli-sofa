###Â Relationship classes

* `hasMany('duck', { relationship: 'barn-ducks' })` with `{ query: 'barn-ducks' }` in `Relationship`
* sortable relationship helper `Relationship.extend({ sortable: sortable('position') })`: needed?
* paginated relationship helper `Relationship.extend({ paginated: paginated(...) })`

```
// models/author.js
export default Model.extend({

  posts: hasMany('post', { inverse: 'author', relationship: 'author-posts' })

});

// models/post.js
export default Model.extend({

  author: belongsTo('author', { inverse: 'posts' })

});

// models/author-posts.js
export default Relationship.extend({

  // `query` or `find` computed property

  query: 'author-posts' // is also set from relationship opts { query }, if present,

  // query has:
  // * database (may be null)
  // * model (parent)
  // * store

  // query is kept in relation.query, looked up by using relation.getQuery(), created in relation.createQuery()

  find: computed('model.docId', function() {
    let key = this.get('model.docId');
    return { ddoc: 'post', view: 'by-author', key };
  }),

  // -- later --
  // search: search('...'),
  // paginated: paginated('...'),

});
```

### changes

* on changes prop (`feed`, `view`, `...`) change `couch:database-changes` should be restarted
* on login, logout, Changes should be restarted. optionally (or better yet `autorun: 'authenticated', ...`)
* enable changes listener only after fastboot shoebox deserialize

### fastboot

* push and retrieve session state from shoebox
  // https://simplabs.com/blog/2016/12/06/out-of-the-box-fastboot-support-in-ember-simple-auth.html
  // implementation might go to ember-cli-couch
* database urls in fastboot v.s. browser (might use `fastboot.request.host`)

### attachments

* allow to override attachment url resolve (per-database)
* use `rev` instead of `_r=revpos` for attachemnt urls. allows fetching deleted doc attachments
* detached attachment models, `model.get('attachments').pushObject(attachment)`
* `store.attachment({ name, data });`
* attachment `data` as a Promise which must resolve to `Blob` or `String` (add scaled image)

### other

* is it possible to provide `promise` prop for `PassiveRelationLoaderStateMixin`?
* `model.save()`, `model.delete()`, ... second call while 1st is pending should return the same promise
* option to delete documents by saving with `_deleted:true` or delete with `{_deleted: true, type:..}`
* per-database models (each database is initialized with model folder name which is returned by `store.databaseOptionsForIdentifier`)
* embedded models (persisted as a `{ key: { model } }`)

## related

* basic CouchDB document api for node.js environment. extract from previous implementation.
* CouchDB API proxy for ACL
