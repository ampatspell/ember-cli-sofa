###Â Relationship classes

* sortable relationship helper `Relationship.extend({ sortable: sortable('position') })`: needed?
* paginated relationship helper `Relationship.extend({ paginated: paginated(...) })`

### Collections

* consider droping collections and adding support for model relationships which are updated w/o inverse
* relationship should be destroyable, not only parent model

### changes

* on changes prop (`feed`, `view`, `...`) change `couch:database-changes` should be restarted
* on login, logout, Changes should be restarted. optionally (or better yet `autorun: 'authenticated', ...`)
* enable changes listener only after fastboot shoebox deserialize

### fastboot

* push and retrieve session state from shoebox
  // https://simplabs.com/blog/2016/12/06/out-of-the-box-fastboot-support-in-ember-simple-auth.html
  // implementation might go to ember-cli-couch
* database urls in fastboot v.s. browser (might use `fastboot.request.host`)

### attachments

* allow to override attachment url resolve (per-database)
* use `rev` instead of `_r=revpos` for attachemnt urls. allows fetching deleted doc attachments
* detached attachment models, `model.get('attachments').pushObject(attachment)`
* `store.attachment({ name, data });`
* attachment `data` as a Promise which must resolve to `Blob` or `String` (add scaled image)

### other

* is it possible to provide `promise` prop for `PassiveRelationLoaderStateMixin`?
* `model.save()`, `model.delete()`, ... second call while 1st is pending should return the same promise
* option to delete documents by saving with `_deleted:true` or delete with `{_deleted: true, type:..}`
* per-database models (each database is initialized with model folder name which is returned by `store.databaseOptionsForIdentifier`)
* embedded models (persisted as a `{ key: { model } }`)

## related

* basic CouchDB document api for node.js environment. extract from previous implementation.
* CouchDB API proxy for ACL
